# Dataset:
I used TESS dataset. There are a set of 200 target words were spoken in the carrier phrase "Say the word _' by two actresses (aged 26 and 64 years) and recordings were made of the set portraying each of seven emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pleasant surprise, sadness, and neutral). There are 2800 data points (audio files) in total.

The dataset is organised such that each of the two female actor and their emotions are contain within its own folder. And within that, all 200 target words audio file can be found. The format of the audio file is a WAV format .

# Feature Exraction Phase:
The feature extraction stage was performed by CNN and LSTM algorithms.

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing tomato pests. The recognition phase makes use of SVM algorithm classifire.
